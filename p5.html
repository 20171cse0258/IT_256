  <h5> Professional Summary </h5>
      <p>This is a resume summary statement that was for  a candidate returning to work after having her own business for 15+ years.

In addition, we highlighted the skills she has honed as a business owner so that she can utilize these qualifications as a sales professional, account manager, and someone knowledgeable about nutrition, medicine, and the overall sales process.
